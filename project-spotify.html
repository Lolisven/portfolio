                During a conversation with my friends, I gathered valuable
                insights regarding their experience with the desktop app version
                of Spotify. The feedback I received was consistent in
                highlighting the challenges associated with navigating through
                the interface, which was perceived as being cluttered with too
                many elements.
              </p>
              <p>
                In particular, users expressed frustration with the time it took
                to complete tasks on the app, which impacted their overall
                experience. This feedback was crucial in informing my redesign
                process, as I focused on streamlining the interface and
                simplifying the user journey to make it more intuitive and
                efficient.

                As part of my redesign of Spotify's homescreen, I conducted a
                user research study with a sample of approximately 6
                individuals, consisting of friends and family members. To ensure
                that my research findings were inclusive and representative, I
                deliberately targeted a few individuals aged 40 and above, who
                tend to have more difficulty navigating through digital
                interfaces.
              </p>
              <p style="padding-bottom: 0">
                Through a combination of one-on-one interviews and surveys, I
                gathered feedback from participants on their likes and dislikes
                of the current interface. This feedback was then compiled and
                analyzed to identify the key issues that were causing
                frustration and confusion for users.
              </p>
              <p>
                To further inform my redesign, I conducted a thorough analysis
                of the user interfaces of Spotify's main competitors. This
                enabled me to identify best practices and innovative solutions
                that could be adapted to improve the user experience of
                Spotify's homescreen. Based on my research findings and
                analysis, I developed a series of wireframes and prototypes,
                which I tested with a small group of participants to gain
                feedback and refine my designs. The final result is a visually
                appealing and user-friendly homescreen that addresses the key
                pain points identified in the research.

                The ideation process involved generating and exploring a variety
                of potential solutions to address the pain points identified
                during the research phase. This was done through a collaborative
                and iterative process that involved brainstorming, sketching
                wireframes, and testing prototypes with users. The resulting
                designs effectively addressed the key pain points identified
                during the research phase. Ultimately, I decided that this one
                was the best of all of them.
