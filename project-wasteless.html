                Food waste is a significant global problem, with a third of all
                produced food going to waste each year. People often forget
                about their food inventory, leading to food spoilage and
                environmental issues. An app that tracks expiration dates and
                sends reminders can be a valuable solution to address this
                issue.

                I conducted a qualitative user research study with 6
                participants to understand their perceptions and experiences
                with an app that tracks food expiration dates and provides
                recipe suggestions. Participants were generally positive about
                the app's concept. Overall, the research provided valuable

                insights about their food waste habits and potential interest in
                using an app to track food expiration dates. Many participants
                expressed frustration with throwing away food that had gone bad,
                and several mentioned using a paper calendar or simply guessing
                when items might expire. Most participants expressed interest in
                using an app that could help them keep track of their food
                expiration dates, with features like barcode scanning, recipe
                suggestions, and customizable reminders. However, some
                participants also mentioned concerns about the effort required

                Based on the results of the study, it is clear that there is a
                demand for an app that tracks food expiration dates and provides
                helpful features to minimize food waste. Participants generally
                expressed interest in using such an app, with many highlighting
                the potential benefits of receiving recipe recommendations and
                using a shopping list feature. However, some users cited
                barriers to use such as the effort required to log food items
                and the need for automatic reminders. Additionally, participants
                expressed a desire for features such as barcode scanning and
                categorization of food items to simplify the tracking process.
                Overall, the insights suggest that an app with clear and
                customizable features that cater to user needs and preferences
                could be successful in reducing food waste and simplifying meal
                planning.

                  opportunity for the app to provide options for reminder
                  frequency and customization.

                <li>
                  Enhancing recipe recommendations: While users were generally
                  positive about the recipe feature, some expressed concerns
                  about the quality of recommendations. This suggests an
                  opportunity to improve the recommendation algorithm and

                After conducting user research and creating user personas, I
                have identified an opportunity to create an app that addresses
                the pain points of food waste due to expiration dates. The app
                will include features such as a shopping list, recipe
                suggestions based on food items that are about to expire, and
                the ability for family members to share one inventory. This will
                not only help users reduce food waste but also simplify the
                process of grocery shopping and meal planning. My goal is to
                provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience that
                seamlessly integrates into the users’ daily routine. I will
                prioritize a clean and visually appealing design, as well as
